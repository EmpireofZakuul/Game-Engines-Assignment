# Game-Engines-Assignment

<h1>Game Idea</h1>
For my Game Engines Assignment I will be doing a procedural city.This city will feature proceduraly generated building with road between them.

<h2>How will I achieve this</h2>
I will achieve the procedural generated city by using perlin noise. This technique will allow me to have some of the buildings different heights in the game as it will sample the perlin noise and then instiate the buildings height from that sample of the perlin noise.

// make sure that you want the game to be a shooter
