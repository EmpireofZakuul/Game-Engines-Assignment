# Game-Engines-Assignment

<h1>Game Idea</h1>
For my Game Engines Assignment, I will be doing a proceduraly generated city shooter game.This city will feature proceduraly generated buildings of differnt heights that the player can roam around.
<br>
</br>
On top of the proceduraly generated city, I will look at using the unity spectrum data to make a sun in the game with rotating rings that reacts to the sound of the game music.

<h2>How will I achieve this?</h2>
I will achieve the proceduraly generated city by using perlin noise. This technique will allow me to have some of the buildings, different heights in the game as it will sample the perlin noise and then instantiate the buildings height from that sample of the perlin noise.

<h2>Player's gaol in the game</h2>
